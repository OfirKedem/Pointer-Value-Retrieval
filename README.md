# Pointer-Value-Retrieval

An *unofficial* PyTorch implementation of the 2021 paper [Pointer Value Retrieval: A new benchmark for understanding the limits of neural network generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12580).

Both the datasets and the models are pure pytorch modules. 

For training we used Pytorch-Lightning.
